# GPU diagnosis

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Case | `$case_id` |
| Source run | $original |
| Timing class | Profiled; excluded from e2e rankings |

$workload

## Measured GPU work

$measured

| Metric | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Measured ranges | Complete `sid_bench/measured` NVTX ranges; warmup excluded |
| Window ms | Union of measured NVTX intervals |
| GPU-active ms | Union of kernel intervals inside measured ranges |
| Kernel sum ms | Sum of kernel durations; overlaps count more than once |
| Share % | Kernel duration / total kernel duration |
| Attribution | Raw kernel names; no inferred semantic stages |

## Kernel breakdown

$kernels

## Artifacts

$artifacts

| Path inside the run | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `diagnostics/<capture>/diagnosis.json` | Capture status and all kernel totals |
| `diagnostics/<capture>/<candidate>/timeline/` | Request, commands, logs, `.nsys-rep` and SQLite trace |

Use the source run's `report` command to rebuild this view without a GPU.
Rerun `e2e` after an optimization to measure its unprofiled impact.
